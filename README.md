## Introduction

Welcome to the source code of my portfolio website. This should give you a very brief (and not quite updated) detail about what I do.

As with most of my documentation, **I don't** do a good job at keeping it updated.

## Deployment

This website is publicly available at [https://hafijul.dev](https://hafijul.dev) and is built from gh-pages branch using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).
